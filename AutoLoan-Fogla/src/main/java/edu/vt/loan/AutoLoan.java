 The following @Named class annotation designates the bean object created by this class
 as a Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) managed bean.

 The "value" attribute defines the logical name of the bean, which is used to access
 the bean in the Expression Language (EL) expressions in a JSF facelets (XHTML) page.

 For example, the bean object's property monthlyPayment can be obtained using the
 EL expression #{autoLoan.monthlyPayment} in the "results" JSF page.

 Marking the AutoLoan class as "implements Serializable" implies that
 instances of the class can be automatically serialized and deserialized.

 Serialization is the process of converting a class instance (object)
 from memory into a suitable format for storage in a file or memory buffer,
 or for transmission across a network connection link.

 Deserialization is the process of recreating a class instance (object)
 in memory from the format under which it was stored.
